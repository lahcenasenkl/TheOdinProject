                <h2>How to Make Spaghetti</h2>
                <p>The only prep work really 
                    is mashing the garlic. The sauce is great on any pasta, 
                    but I prefer angel hair or Spaghetti.</p>

                <h2>How to Make Spaghetti Step-By-Step</h2>
                <p>Here's a very detailed overview of what you can expect when 
                    you make homemade Spaghetti:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pour olive oil into cold skillet. Add garlic, capers, 
                        anchovy paste, and red pepper flakes. Place over medium 
                        heat and cook and stir until the oil is infused with the 
                        flavors of the mixture, about 5 minutes, taking care not 
                        to brown the garlic. Add tomato sauce and rinse jar with 
                        1/4 cup water; add water to skillet. Pour in wine and 
                        juice from clams, reserving the clams. Bring to a simmer 
                        until slightly reduced and thickened, 7 to 9 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                        Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring 
                        occasionally until almost al dente, or about 1 minute 
                        less than directed on package. Drain. Return pasta to 
                        the pot off heat.</li>
                    <li>Stir clams into the sauce. Pour sauce over pasta. Stir; 
                        cover the pot to allow it to finish cooking off heat and 
                        to allow the pasta will absorb some of the sauce, about 3 
                        minutes. Stir in Parmesan cheese. Top with chopped fresh 
                        basil and/or parsley.</li>
                </ol>
